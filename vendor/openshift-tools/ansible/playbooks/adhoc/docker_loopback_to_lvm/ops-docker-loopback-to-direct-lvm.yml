#!/usr/bin/ansible-playbook
---
# This playbook coverts docker to go from loopback to direct-lvm (the Red Hat recommended way to run docker).
#
# It requires the block device to be already provisioned and attached to the host. This is a generic playbook,
# meant to be used for manual conversion. For AWS specific conversions, use the other playbook in this directory.
#
#  To run:
#   ./ops-docker-loopback-to-direct-lvm.yml -e cli_host=<host to run on> -e cli_docker_device=<path to device>
#
#  Example:
#   ./ops-docker-loopback-to-direct-lvm.yml -e cli_host=twiesttest-master-fd32 -e cli_docker_device=/dev/sdb
#
#  Notes:
#  * This will remove /var/lib/docker!
#  * You may need to re-deploy docker images after this is run (like monitoring)
